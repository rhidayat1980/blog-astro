## Introduction to Terraform CDK

The Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF) allows you to use familiar programming languages to define and provision infrastructure. This series focuses on using TypeScript with CDKTF, combining the power of Terraform's infrastructure management with TypeScript's type safety and modern development features.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 16 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Terraform CLI
- Git

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

First, install the CDK for Terraform CLI:

```bash
npm install --global cdktf-cli
```

Create a new project:

```bash
mkdir my-terraform-cdk
cd my-terraform-cdk
cdktf init --template="typescript" --local
```

This command creates a new TypeScript project with the following structure:

```plaintext
my-terraform-cdk/
├── .gen/
├── .gitignore
├── cdktf.json
├── help
├── jest.config.js
├── main.ts
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── __tests__/
```

## Understanding the Project Structure

- `cdktf.json`: Configuration file for your CDK for Terraform project
- `main.ts`: Main application file where you define your infrastructure
- `.gen/`: Generated provider bindings
- `__tests__/`: Directory for your tests

## Your First CDK Application

Let's create a simple AWS infrastructure using CDKTF. First, install the AWS provider:

```bash
npm install @cdktf/provider-aws
```

Update your `main.ts`:

```typescript
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { App, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
import { AwsProvider } from "@cdktf/provider-aws/lib/provider";
import { Instance } from "@cdktf/provider-aws/lib/instance";

class MyStack extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);

    // AWS Provider
    new AwsProvider(this, "AWS", {
      region: "us-west-2",
    });

    // EC2 Instance
    new Instance(this, "HelloWorld", {
      ami: "ami-0735c191cf914754d",
      instanceType: "t2.micro",
      tags: {
        Name: "HelloWorld",
      },
    });
  }
}

const app = new App();
new MyStack(app, "my-stack");
app.synth();
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Constructs

Constructs are the basic building blocks of CDK apps. They represent a cloud component and encapsulate everything AWS CDK needs to create the component.

### 2. Stacks

Stacks are the unit of deployment in CDK. They contain constructs and are deployed as a single unit.

### 3. Apps

The App construct is the root of your CDK application. It's responsible for synthesizing the Terraform configuration.

## Working with CDKTF

### Synthesizing

To generate Terraform configuration:

```bash
cdktf synth
```

This command creates a `cdktf.out` directory containing the synthesized Terraform configuration.

### Deploying

To deploy your infrastructure:

```bash
cdktf deploy
```

### Destroying

To destroy the infrastructure:

```bash
cdktf destroy
```

## TypeScript Benefits

Using TypeScript with CDKTF provides several advantages:

1. **Type Safety**: Catch errors before deployment
2. **IDE Support**: Get autocompletion and inline documentation
3. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Use classes and inheritance
4. **Modern Development Features**: Utilize async/await, modules, and more

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Always use version control for your CDK projects
2. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript's type system
3. **Code Organization**: Keep stacks focused and modular
4. **Documentation**: Document your constructs and configurations
5. **Testing**: Write unit tests for your constructs

## Next Steps

In [Part 2: Resource Management with CDK](/posts/terraform-cdk/02-resource-management), we'll explore how to manage different types of resources, handle dependencies, and work with state in CDKTF.
