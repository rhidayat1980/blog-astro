## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, it is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

## Core Components

### Control Plane Components

The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster. Here are its main components:

1. **kube-apiserver**
   - The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane
   - Exposes the Kubernetes API
   - Handles all administrative operations

2. **etcd**
   - Consistent and highly-available key value store
   - Stores all cluster data
   - Source of truth for cluster state

3. **kube-scheduler**
   - Watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node
   - Selects a node for them to run on
   - Considers resource requirements, hardware/software constraints, etc.

4. **kube-controller-manager**
   - Runs controller processes
   - Handles node failures
   - Maintains correct number of pods
   - Manages service accounts and API access tokens

### Node Components

Components that run on every node:

1. **kubelet**
   - Ensures containers are running in a Pod
   - Manages container lifecycle
   - Reports node and Pod status to the API server

2. **kube-proxy**
   - Maintains network rules on nodes
   - Handles Pod networking and service abstraction
   - Implements part of the Kubernetes Service concept

3. **Container Runtime**
   - Software responsible for running containers
   - Examples: containerd, CRI-O

## Basic Kubernetes Objects

### Pods

- Smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
- Can contain one or more containers
- Share network namespace and storage
- Always scheduled together

### Deployments

- Declares desired state for Pods
- Handles rolling updates and rollbacks
- Manages ReplicaSets
- Ensures availability during updates

### Services

- Exposes Pods as network services
- Provides stable endpoints
- Types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer
- Handles service discovery and load balancing

### ConfigMaps and Secrets

- Store configuration data
- Decouple configuration from Pod specifications
- Secrets are for sensitive data
- Can be mounted as files or environment variables

## Next Steps

This introduction covers the basic architecture and components of Kubernetes. In future posts, we'll dive deeper into:

- Pod lifecycle and scheduling
- Networking concepts
- Storage management
- Security best practices
- Advanced deployment strategies

Stay tuned for more detailed posts about each of these topics!
