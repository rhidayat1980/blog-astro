## Understanding Table of Contents

A Table of Contents (TOC) is a crucial navigation element in long-form content. This post demonstrates various heading levels and structures to test TOC generation.

## Basic TOC Structure

The TOC typically reflects the document's heading hierarchy. In markdown, we use different numbers of hash symbols (#) to denote heading levels:

- Single # for H1
- Double ## for H2
- Triple ### for H3
And so on...

### Nested Sections

Nested sections help organize content hierarchically. This H3 heading should appear indented in the TOC under its parent H2 section.

#### Deep Nesting Example

This H4 heading tests how deep the TOC rendering goes.

## Content Organization

Good content organization makes articles more readable and navigable.

### Using Descriptive Headers

Headers should be clear and descriptive, helping readers understand the content structure at a glance.

### Consistent Hierarchy

Maintain a logical heading hierarchy throughout your content:

1. Don't skip levels
2. Keep similar content at the same level
3. Use appropriate nesting

## Advanced TOC Features

Modern TOC implementations often include additional features.

### Smooth Scrolling

When clicking TOC links, the page should scroll smoothly to the target section.

### Active Section Highlighting

The current section should be highlighted in the TOC as the user scrolls through the content.

## Edge Cases

Testing various edge cases helps ensure robust TOC functionality.

### Empty Sections

This section has no content other than its heading.

### Multiple H1s
# Another H1 Heading

While not typically recommended, some documents might have multiple H1 headings. The TOC should handle this appropriately.

## Conclusion

This post now serves as both a test case and documentation for TOC functionality. By including various heading levels and structures, we can ensure our TOC implementation works correctly across different content patterns.
