If this is working correctly, this post should only be accessible in a dev environment, as well as any tags that are unique to this post.

## Understanding Draft Posts

Draft posts are an essential feature in content management systems and static site generators. They allow content creators to:

1. Work on content without making it public
2. Preview how the post will look in the development environment
3. Get feedback from team members before publication
4. Maintain multiple versions of content

## How Draft Posts Work in Astro

In Astro, draft posts are controlled by the `draft` flag in the frontmatter. When set to `true`, the post will only be visible in the development environment. This is particularly useful for:

- Content review processes
- Work-in-progress articles
- Testing new content formats
- Preparing scheduled content releases

## Testing Features

This post also serves as a testing ground for various blog features such as:

- Markdown formatting
- Tag functionality
- Content organization
- Development environment configurations

Feel free to use this post as a template for future draft content testing!
